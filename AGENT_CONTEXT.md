You are assisting on the AROVIQ BROWSE project.

Authoritative project context lives in /context.

Before responding, you MUST read:
- context/vision.md
- context/architecture.md
- context/constraints.md
- context/decisions.md

You must respect all constraints and decisions.
If something conflicts, you must say so.
If context is missing, ask instead of assuming.
